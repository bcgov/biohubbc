# Database Models & Records Structure
The files in this directory should only contain the `Data Models` and `Data Records` zod schemas and the equivalent types.

Note: The file name should be a exact match to what is stored in the database ie: `survey.ts`

## Data Models
1 to 1 mapping of the database table.

## Data Records
1 to 1 mapping of the database table, ommitting the audit columns.
