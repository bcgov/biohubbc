        To translate a sample-based count into an estimate of total count, the  observed count must be divided by the probabilty of seeing or catching an animal (sightability). For example, if we count 40 birds during a Survey and we know that we only see 80% of the total number of birds actually present, then population estimate = 40 * 1/0.80 = 50 birds.
