# BioDiversityHub BC

Sub-project under the SEISM Capital project, the source of BCâ€™s species inventory data.

The objectives for the BioHubBC project are:

- To provide a single source for aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data.
- To reduce the barriers for collecting and sharing aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data throughout the province of British Columbia.
- To reduce the effort involved with managing aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data.
- To improve access for all stakeholders to the aquatic and terrestrial species and habitat data needed to make informed decisions and policies for the province.

# Running Locally with Docker

See `./Makefile` for all available commands.

## Pre-reqs

### Install Docker

Note: this setup uses volumes to support live reload. You will need to ensure that you grant docker access to whichever hard-drive you are working in.

### Initialize the `./env` file.

This will copy `./env_config/env.docker` to `./.env`  
Note: this file may need additional editing to provide secrets for external services (like S3).

```
make env
```

_Note: you will need to use a terminal that supports make, etc. On Mac this is the default terminal, on Windows you can use something like `git-bash`._

## Run all projects

Builds and runs the database (including migrations/seeding), api, web and ionic apps.

```
make all
```

## Run only backend projects

Runs the database (including migrations/seeding) and api.

```
make backend
```

## Run web projects

Runs the database (including migrations/seeding), api, and web app.

```
make web
```

## Run ionic projects

Runs the database (including migrations/seeding), api, and ionic app.

```
make ionic
```

## Access the running applications

api:

- `localhost:6100/api/`
- `localhost:80/api/`

app:

- `localhost:7100`

app-ionic

- `localhost:8100`

# Helpful Makefile Commands

See `./Makefile` for all available commands.  
The most common commands, other than the ones mentioned above which run the project(s).

### Close all containers

```
make close
```

### Close and delete all containers/artifacts

```
make clean
```

### Shell into a container (database, api, app, app-ionic)

```
make database
```

```
make api
```

```
make app
```

```
make app-ionic
```

### Prune Docker Artifacts

This will aggressively delete docker artifacts to recover docker hard-drive space.

See [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) for OPTIONS.

```
docker system prune [OPTIONS]
```

See [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_prune/) for OPTIONS.

```
docker volume prune [OPTIONS]
```

# Helpful Docker Commands

### Show all running containers

`docker ps`

### Show all containers (running and closed)

`docker ps -a`

### View the logs for a container

`docker logs <container id or name>`  
Include `-f` to "follow" the container logs, showing logs in real time
